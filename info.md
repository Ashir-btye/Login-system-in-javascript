Professional Login System with Admin Panel (HTML, JS, Bootstrap)

Key Features:
Login Form:

The form contains two input fields: one for the username and one for the password.
It uses Bootstrap for styling, which provides a clean and responsive design.
There is a submit button that the user can click to attempt logging in.
Validation:

If either the username or password is empty, an error message is displayed, asking the user to fill out both fields.
If the entered credentials do not match the predefined values (admin and 12345), an error message will be shown saying "Invalid username or password!"
Admin Panel:

If the credentials are correct, the login form is hidden, and a personalized admin panel is displayed.
The admin panel welcomes the user with a message: "Welcome to the Admin Panel, M. Ashir Hasnain!" and includes a logout button.
Logout:

The logout button on the admin panel hides the panel and reveals the login form again.
Responsive Design:

The entire page is styled with Bootstrap, ensuring that it looks good on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
